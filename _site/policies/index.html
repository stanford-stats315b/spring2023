Students may discuss and work on homework problems in groups. However, each student must write down the solution independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. Each student must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by themself. Additionally, each student must write their own code in the programming part of the assignment. When working in study groups, you must indicate on each homework with whom you collaborated.</p><p>For concept quizzes, these are to be completed completely on your own without discussion.</p><p>It is an honor code violation to copy, refer to, or look at written or code solutions from a previous year, including but not limited to: official solutions from a previous year, solutions posted online, and solutions you or someone else may have written up in a previous year. Furthermore, it is an honor code violation to post your assignment solutions online, such as on a public git repo. We run plagiarism-detection software on your code against past solutions as well as student submissions from current and previous years. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the Stanford Honor Code.</p><p>In summary, we expect students to want to learn and not Google for answers or copy those of other students. The purpose of assignments and concept quizzes in this course is to help you think about the material, not just give us the right answers. Please ask us if you are unsure about the use of a particular reference.</p><h2 id="regrade-policy"> <a href="#regrade-policy" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="regrade-policy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Regrade policy</h2><p>If you feel that we have made an error in grading your homework assignment or concept quiz, please wait 24 hours before submitting a regrade request after grading has been published. Subsequently, submit a regrade request via <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/379982">Gradescope</a>, including a detailed written explanation, within one week of grades being published. Please note that regrading of the work may cause your grade to go up or down.</p><h2 id="late-day-policy"> <a href="#late-day-policy" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="late-day-policy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Late day policy</h2><p>Every student is allotted 3 free LATE DAYs throughout the entire quarter, which may be used on homework assignments, the project proposal, or project milestone. (Late days cannot be used for the final project report or poster due to grading constraints.)</p><p>After these late days are exhausted, late assignments will incur a reduction of 33% in the final score for each day (or part thereof) it is late. For example, if an assignment is up to 24 hours late, it incurs a penalty of 33%. Else if it is up to 48 hours late, it incurs a penalty of 66%. And if it is 72 or more hours late, it will receive no credit.</p><p>You must turn in all homework assignments, even if for zero credit, in order to pass the course.</p><h2 id="general-course-policies"> <a href="#general-course-policies" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="general-course-policies"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> General course policies</h2><ul><li>Gender expression/identity: This course affirms people of all gender expressions and gender identities. If you prefer to be called a different name than what is indicated on the class roster, please let me know. Feel free to correct me on your preferred gender pronoun. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.<li>Code of conduct: You are expected to treat the instructional team and your fellow students with courtesy and respect. This class should be a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. Harassment of any form will not be tolerated. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of the instructors. If you are not comfortable approaching the instructional team, you may also contact the Stanford Office of the Ombuds<li>Students with Documented Disabilities: If you have an OAE letter, please present it to <a href="mailto:stats315b-spr2122-staff@lists.stanford.edu">stats315b-spr2122-staff@lists.stanford.edu</a> at your earliest convenience, so we can ensure that the course materials and staff support comply with your needs.<li>Statement on Recordings: Video cameras located in the back of the room will capture the instructor presentations in this course. For your convenience, you can access these recordings by logging into the course Canvas site. These recordings might be reused in other Stanford courses, viewed by other Stanford students, faculty, or staff, or used for other education and research purposes. Note that while the cameras are positioned with the intention of recording only the instructor, occasionally a part of your image or voice might be incidentally captured. If you have questions, please contact a member of the teaching team.</ul><h2 id="course-assistance-and-personal-support"> <a href="#course-assistance-and-personal-support" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="course-assistance-and-personal-support"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Course assistance and personal support</h2><p>In every quarter we have taught, there have been individual students who have encountered life-altering challenges, so it is not the case that empathy and compassion have only just become relevant. However, the magnitude of the current crises underscores the need to support each other. If you feel overwhelmed for any reason—by work for this class, or a family issue, or just the weight of the present moment for the globe, please do not hesitate to reach out. Additionally, you can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus <a href="https://vaden.stanford.edu/caps-and-wellness/counseling-and-psychological- services-caps">here</a>. Especially under such conditions, we appreciate your participation in our course, and we will do everything we can to support you.</p><hr><footer><p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class">Just the Class</a></p></footer></div></div><div class="search-overlay"></div></div>
